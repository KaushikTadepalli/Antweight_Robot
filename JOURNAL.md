# Day 1: Decisions

The goal for today is to finalize the overall robot geometry and make some key design decisions.

We started by looking for inspiration, and came up with the following robots that we could use for reference.

Our first ideas were based around this style of vertical spinner, with a narrow body, 2wd, and a small vertical hubmotor in the center. We liked its ability to quickly self-right, and the minimal weight requirements of direct drive 2 wheel drive, but didn't like the bite and reach that the small weapon diameter provided.

To increase the weapon diameter, we decided to push it further forward and lower to the ground, more similar to the large diameter vertical spinners such as the one to the right. However, we still wanted to keep the dustpan style and self-righting ability of the original design, so we ended up with a combination of the two.

By the end of the day, our robot's side profile sketch looked like this, with a weapon diameter of 2.75" and a wheel diameter of 1.375". 

Additionally, we had made some decisions about our drivetrain. As per our project guidelines, we want the robot to have a powerful drive system and be able to control the opponent. This led us to choose a pair of brushless Repeat Mini motors as our drive system, with Banebots wheels for grip. Although more expensive and heavier than N20s or even normal brushed motors, we believe that these motors will give us an advantage in pushing matches and overall driver ability.

That about wraps up our day 1 blog, see you tomorrow!
