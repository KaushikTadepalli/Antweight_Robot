# Project Goal: 
Build an antweight combat robot to compete at West Coast Combat Robotics League's June event.

## Guidelines:
### Needs:
1. Relatively cheap <$350
2. Easily manufacturable (mostly 3d printing and laser)
3. Reliable method to self-right
### Wants:
1. Uses a vertical hubmotor disk as its weapon
2. Has wedgelets or dustpan for control
3. Powerful but controllable drive
4. Looks cool
### Won't:
1. Build a horizontal
2. Build a solely control bot
